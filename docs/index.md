## Coordinated MediumSlow Test – July 2025

We’re running a community test to see if **MediumSlow** is a better fit for NYC than LongFast. The test will begin on **July 6, 2025** and continue for a few weeks until we decide next steps together. Check back here and in the Discord channel for updates and discussion.

We previously tested **MediumFast** starting July 1, but it significantly reduced range — many nodes couldn't reach each other.

## How to Join the MediumSlow Test

1. **Back up your keys**  
   `Meshtastic App > Security > Key Backup`

2. **Make sure you're on firmware 2.6.x or later**  
   [Firmware flasher within 'Node Setup Instructions'](https://nyme.sh/setup.html).

3. **Change your LoRa preset**  
   `Meshtastic App > Settings > LoRa >` **`Medium Range - Slow`** or **`MEDIUM_SLOW`**  
   Make sure **Frequency Slot** is set to **52** (or **0** if your channel name is "Medium Slow")

## Node Setup Instructions
The community has compiled a list of [Setup](https://nyme.sh/setup.html) resources to help everyone get nodes setup correctly.  Please take the time to review [this information](https://nyme.sh/setup.html).  This is also a great reference to aid in troubleshooting your software configuration.
