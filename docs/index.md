# Welcome to the party!

nyme.sh is a group of enthusiasts who love Meshtastic! Most of us are in the New York City metro area, but anyone with an interest is invited to join—no matter where you’re from. If you’re curious about Meshtastic or other mesh radio technologies, we’d love to have you be part of our community! Join us on Discord to chat with the crew.  See you there ;)

- See [**Getting Started**](/getting-started) to get up and running with the area network

(If you’re looking for the mesh WiFi network, see [NYC Mesh](https://www.nycmesh.net/).)


## Current Meshtastic Settings

The main nyme.sh [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) network is currently operating on the out-of-the-box defaults: `LongFast` preset, Frequency Slot `20`. See the [recommended configuration](/getting-started#meshtastic) for Meshtastic nodes.


## Preset Testing

We are actively seeking viable alternate radio settings. Check the [preset testing](/preset-testing/) page for the latest info.
