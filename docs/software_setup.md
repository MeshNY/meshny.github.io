# Node Setup Tips
- [Getting Started](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/) - official Meshtastic.org Getting Started Guide. This guide has the following sections:
  - [Install Serial Drivers](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/serial-drivers/)
  - [Flash Firmware](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/) - Thereâ€™s constant releases with bugfixes, general improvements and new features. Please update often to stable releases!
  - [Initial Configuration](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/initial-config/)

- Number of hops
  - Default: 3
  - Set your Number of hops to 3 or 4
  - Meshtastic App > LoRa > Number of hops
    
> **_NOTE:_**  The default of `3` should be sufficent in a healthy mesh.  "Really, 3 is fine." 4 or 5 if running CLIENT_MUTE and/or having particular difficulties, but with such a small and densely packed geographic area you are quite likely to have those higher hopped packets leave the Metro area and end up rebroadcasted over 100 miles away! Hello Catskills! This prevents the reverse of the effect we occassionally encounter where Meshes in North PA or CT will show up on the Mesh in NYC, even though they're >75miles away, because they're running 7 hops.

- MQTT
  - Ignore MQTT
    - Default: Enabled
    - Meshtastic App > Lora > Ignore MQTT
  - Ok to MQTT
    - Default: Disabled
    - Meshtastic App > Lora > Ok to MQTT
- Device Role
  - Default: Client
  - Set your Device Role to `CLIENT` or `CLIENT_MUTE`
  - Meshtastic App > Device > Device Role

> **_NOTE:_**  Unless you have access to 100th flr of 1WTC or Empire State Building, you shouldn't be using an "infrastructure" role such as `REPEATER`, `ROUTER`, `ROUTER_CLIENT` or `ROUTER_LATE`. While you may have the most honest and pure of intentions in choosing such a role the reality is they will pre-empt the large and ever-increasing number of clients`s from retranmission resulting in an over-all diminishment of the mesh's full potential. Please, don't be that person and read up on the [importance of choosing the right device role](https://meshtastic.org/blog/choosing-the-right-device-role/).

- Rebroadcast Mode
  - Default: All
  - Meshtastic App > Device > Rebroadcast Mode
  - Set to `Core Portnums Only' to only rebroadcasts packets with standard portnums: NodeInfo, Text, Position, Telemetry, and Routing.
 
 > **_NOTE:_**  Ignores packets from non-standard portnums such as: TAK, RangeTest, PaxCounter, etc. Should help lower high channel utilization.

If you use [the `meshtastic` python-cli](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/python/cli/) and have been seeing the following error:
```Python
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe0 in position 8: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe0 in position 8: unexpected end of data in field: meshtastic.protobuf.User.long_name```
```
What is happening is someone managed to use a non-UTF8 char in their device name (both long and short) so the fix is to run:
```bash
meshtastic --remove-node '!0c3a9bb0' && meshtastic --set-ignored-node '!0c3a9bb0'
```
