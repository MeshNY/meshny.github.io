# NiceRa-Solar Build BOM List provided by Signals Rising

Solar Node node based on the NiceRa design — a small form-factor board using an NRF52 (Pro-Micro) micro-controller and an SX1262 radio module. These nodes are ideal for deployment in areas with limited infrastructure — for emergency communications, community networks, or off-grid connectivity.
